## How to play

There is no ingame tutorial or anything, so I describe rules here. 

You are a shelter operator and your job is to fullfil the needs of shelter inhabitants. At start there are 5 humans, but each minute settle another one. When inhabitant wait over some room, you should fullfil his need by solving respective "puzzle" in bottom part of the screen. For example, for second room (toilet) you should solve second panel. You should figure out how to sholve individual puzzles by yourself. For wrong solution, you will be punished in points. Points are displayed at the top white bar. When this bar is over, you lose. You should manage needs as long as you can.
